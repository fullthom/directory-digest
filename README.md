# Directory Digest

This is a simple Python-based CLI that generates a report of the filesystem structure from a specified path.
It collates README.md files to describe the purpose of each directory.

To run:
`python3 run.py <path to a dir to analyze>`

For instance, to run for iCloud dDive on a Mac: 
`python3 run.py ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs`
